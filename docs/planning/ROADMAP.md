# Rackula — Product Roadmap

Strategic vision and the active plan. For live work items, see
[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/milestones).
For the kanban board tracking issue flow, see the
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/RackulaLives/projects/2).

## Vision

Rackula is a lightweight, FOSS, web-based rack layout designer for homelabbers. It prioritises:

- **Simplicity** — Do one thing well: visual rack planning
- **Offline-first** — Works without accounts or cloud services
- **Self-hostable** — Deployable on your own infrastructure
- **Community-driven** — Built by homelabbers, for homelabbers

---

## Version Philosophy

**The app uses CalVer; published packages use SemVer** — versioned independently because
they address different audiences. See the decision record:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-versioning-policy-calver-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-versioning-policy-calver-design.md)
(resolves [#1315](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/issues/1315)).

| Artifact | Audience | Scheme | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rackula app** (web / Docker / LXC) | end users → recency | **CalVer `YY.M.MICRO`** | `v26.6.0` |
| **`@rackula/core`** (if/when published) | developers → compatibility | **SemVer** | `core/v0.4.0` |

- **MICRO** is a mechanical per-month counter (same month → `MICRO++`; new month → `0`),
  so there is no minor-vs-patch decision per release.
- **Month is unpadded** (`26.6.0`, not `26.06.0`) to stay valid-semver-shaped.
- Milestones are **theme-led and sequentially ordered**, not time-boxed. CalVer reflects
  the ship date, not the plan date. Multiple milestones may ship in one month.

---

## Active Plan

Milestones are thematic groups with sequential ordering. Each maps to a GitHub milestone.
Status markers show current state: ✅ complete, 🟡 in progress, 🔵 next, 🔴 planned.

### ✅ M1 — LXC Build & Hardening (complete)

Build the Proxmox LXC distribution **and** the self-host API hardening, so the eventual
public release ships secure. **No public submission in this sprint** — we build and harden
first, submit in M2.

- **LXC packaging:** #1211 (epic), #1212 (tarball pipeline), #1213 (install files),
  plus install-pipeline polish #1233, #1234, #1238, #1239, #1240
- **Self-host hardening (bundled):** #1235 (systemd), #1237 (CORS HTTPS), #1269 (session
  invalidation), #1778 (write-route rate limiting), #1779 (mutating-origin policy)

### 🟡 M2 — LXC Release & Stability (in progress)

Ship LXC publicly, finish in-flight work, and close remaining hardening.

- **Public release:** #1214 (test on Proxmox), #1215 (submit to community-scripts),
  #1216 (icon)
- **Hardening tail:** #1274 (epic), #1780 (storage guardrails)
- **In-flight + stability:** #1390 (persistence-error UX), #1387 (error-handling epic),
  #910 (layout-store split), #756 (height slider), #571 (JSON Schema)

### 🔵 M3 — Data Format & Interop (next)

Highest-priority strategic work; also the groundwork that feeds the (still-exploratory)
`@rackula/core` library direction ([#1758](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/issues/1758)).

- **Epics/initiative:** #1208 (Ecosystem Interop), #1209 (Format Adapters), #570 (Dev-friendly Data Format)
- **Format/interop work:** #617, #618 (YAML save/load), #620 (JSZip), #627/#628/#629 (git sync),
  #746, #1113 (schema-versioning spike), #1114 (regression coverage)

### 🔴 M4 — Type Safety, Decomposition & Stability (planned)

Technical debt paydown milestone. Zero feature work. Every issue measurably improves type
safety, maintainability, or reliability.

- **TypeScript strict burndown:** #1705 (utils, 49 errors), #1706 (stores, 8 errors),
  #1707 (components, 23 errors), #1708 (test helpers, 4 errors) — eliminates all 84
  suppressed `@ts-nocheck` errors across 25 files
- **Component decomposition:** #1396 (export.ts), #1610 (Canvas.svelte), #1398
  (EditPanel.svelte) — splits 3 large files into focused modules
- **Data-integrity bugs:** #1479 (auto-import undo), #1478 (image re-keying) — silent
  corruption bugs that threaten user layouts
- **E2E infrastructure:** #1423 (ESLint rule for CSS selectors), #1419 (data-testid)
- **CI reliability:** #1394 (lockfile sync root cause)

---

## Backlog

Everything not in the active plan lives in the **Backlog** milestone. Notable clusters:

- **Connection / cabling** — epics #71 and #362 and their children. ⚠️ These two epics
  overlap and spawned near-duplicate issues; **reconcile them before scheduling** a sprint.
- **In-app YAML editor** — epic #1174 (#1175/#1176/#1178) + #1119 (ZIP de-emphasis).
- **Embeddable / GIS** — epic #1210.
- **Internationalisation** — epic #181.
- **Taxonomy debt** — ~16 issues carry the legacy `enhancement` label without `feature`;
  worth a one-time reconciliation.

---

## Out of Scope

Features that will **not** be implemented:

- Backend/database requirements (beyond the optional self-host persistence API)
- User accounts (without a dedicated cloud-sync feature)
- Internet Explorer support
- Native mobile apps

---

## Contributing

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/issues) for ways to contribute:

- Issues labelled `ready` are available for implementation
- Issues labelled `triage` need maintainer review first
- Feature requests welcome via the issue template
