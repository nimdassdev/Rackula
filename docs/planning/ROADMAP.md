# Rackula -- Product Roadmap

Strategic vision and the active plan. For live work items, see
[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/milestones).
For the kanban board tracking issue flow, see the
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/RackulaLives/projects/2).

---

## Vision

Rackula is a lightweight, FOSS, web-based rack layout designer for homelabbers. It prioritises:

- Simplicity -- Do one thing well: visual rack planning
- Offline-first -- Works without accounts or cloud services
- Self-hostable -- Deployable on your own infrastructure
- Community-driven -- Built by homelabbers, for homelabbers

---

## Version Philosophy

The app uses CalVer; published packages use SemVer -- versioned independently because
they address different audiences. See the decision record:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-versioning-policy-calver-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-versioning-policy-calver-design.md)
(resolves [#1315](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/issues/1315)).

| Artifact | Audience | Scheme | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rackula app** (web / Docker / LXC) | end users → recency | **CalVer `YY.M.MICRO`** | `v26.6.0` |
| **`@rackula/core`** (if/when published) | developers → compatibility | **SemVer** | `core/v0.4.0` |

- MICRO is a mechanical per-month counter (same month → `MICRO++`; new month → `0`),
  so there is no minor-vs-patch decision per release.
- Month is unpadded (`26.6.0`, not `26.06.0`) to stay valid-semver-shaped.
- Milestones are theme-led and sequentially ordered, not time-boxed. CalVer reflects
  the ship date, not the plan date. Multiple milestones may ship in one month.

---

## Active Plan

Milestones are thematic groups with sequential ordering. Each maps to a GitHub milestone.
Execution order: **M02 -> M04 -> M03 -> M07 -> M05 -> M06 -> M08 -> M09 -> M10 -> M11 -> M12 -> M13**.

M4 precedes M3 because type-safety cleanup must happen before data format changes.
Changing data formats with `@ts-nocheck` on 20 files and 84 suppressed errors risks
silent type mismatches in the data layer. M09-M13 follow M06 because they extend
connectivity and depend on enriched device models and stable data formats.

### M01 -- LXC Build & Hardening (complete)

Build the Proxmox LXC distribution and the self-host API hardening, so the eventual
public release ships secure. No public submission in this milestone -- we build and harden
first, submit in M2.

- LXC packaging: #1211 (epic), #1212 (tarball pipeline), #1213 (install files),
  plus install-pipeline polish #1233, #1234, #1238, #1239, #1240
- Self-host hardening (bundled): #1235 (systemd), #1237 (CORS HTTPS), #1269 (session
  invalidation), #1778 (write-route rate limiting), #1779 (mutating-origin policy)

### M02 -- LXC Release & Stability (in progress, 11 issues)

Ship LXC publicly and stabilise the release pipeline.

- Public release: #1211 (epic), #1214 (test on Proxmox), #1215 (submit to
  community-scripts), #1317 (submit as Unraid Community App)
- Release pipeline: #1977 (gated release pipeline), #1969 (v26.6.2 install bug)
- CI/infra: #1394 (CI/Build reliability), #567 (Playwright on self-hosted runner)
- Cleanup: #1970 (remove Umami analytics), #1011 (nginx proxy query string)

### M04 -- Type Safety, Decomposition & Stability (next, 22 issues)

Technical debt paydown that must complete before data format changes (M03) or new
features (M07, M05) can land safely. Every issue measurably improves type safety,
maintainability, or reliability.

- TypeScript strict burndown: #1705 (utils, 49 errors), #1707 (components, 23 errors)
  -- eliminates suppressed `@ts-nocheck` errors
- Component decomposition: #1388 (epic), #910 (layout.svelte.ts), #1396 (export.ts),
  #1398 (EditPanel.svelte), #1610 (Canvas.svelte), #1397 (Rack.svelte)
- Layout store decomposition: #1077 (phase 2), #1079 (phase 4), #1080 (phase 5)
- Architecture: #746 (svstate patterns spike), #1387 (error handling audit)
- Bugs: #1581 (import missing devices)
- E2E quality: #1423 (ESLint CSS rule), #1419 (data-testid), #1264 (stale selectors),
  #1420 (getByRole migration), #1227 (undo/redo E2E), #1231 (a11y E2E),
  #1222 (E2E testing epic)

### M03 -- Data Format & Interop (planned, 18 issues)

Data format foundation and interoperability. Enables later milestones (M07 device
enrichment, M08 share URLs). Must follow M04 for type safety.

- Epics/initiative: #1208 (Ecosystem Interop), #1209 (Format Adapters),
  #570 (Dev-friendly Data Format)
- Format work: #617, #618 (YAML save/load), #620 (JSZip), #627/#628/#629 (git sync),
  #1113 (schema versioning spike), #1114 (regression coverage)
- Schema: #571 (JSON Schema)
- In-app YAML editor: #1174 (epic), #1175 (viewer), #1176 (edit/apply flow),
  #1177 (lazy-load guardrails), #1178 (inline diagnostics)
- Deferred: #1119 (ZIP de-emphasis after YAML default, blocked on YAML stabilising)

### M07 -- Device Library & Image System (planned, 17 issues)

Device model enrichment, image system, and UX audit. Prerequisite for M05/M06
connectivity (ports need the enriched device model).

  #1189 (manifest integrity checks)
- Import: #1283 (harden NetBox import), #1108 (Phase 3 NetBox devices),
  #1190 (vendor asset directory spike)
- UX: #788 (Edit Device Panel design audit)

### M05 -- Connectivity Core (planned, 13 issues)

The 80/20 slice: connection model, port rendering, and basic click-to-connect.
Data model fields (gender, signal_type) are in M05 because they are prerequisites
for M06's advanced features.

audio signal chain management.

- Share infra: #820 (Cloudflare Workers URL shortener), #818 (multi-rack share schema),
  #821 (share URL architecture docs), #823 (self-hosted shortener guide)
- Share dialog fixes: #1130 (QR performance), #1131 (aspect-ratio fallback),
  #1132 (responsive preview), #1133 (keyboard/screen-reader close flow)

### M09 -- Connectivity & Power Extensions (planned, 18 issues)

Extensions of M05/M06 connectivity work that depend on the core model shipping first.
Includes power distribution and multi-rack E2E testing.

- Connection UX: #264 (mobile workflow), #265 (cable details), #266 (hover highlighting),
  #258 (interface config in Add Device), #275 (mobile UX for ports)
- Rendering: #252 (port display in image mode), #356 (multi-row port layout),
  #360 (10-inch rack optimisation), #271 (console port), #269 (patch panel pass-through),

- Data/store: #268 (undo/redo for cables), #267 (external connections),
  #367 (InternalConnection generalisation)
- Power: #368 (Power interface types and InterfaceRole), #270 (power port visualisation)
- E2E: #1230 (Multi-Rack & Bayed Rack E2E)

### M10 -- Isometric, Advanced Export & GIS (planned, 10 issues)

Advanced export capabilities. High effort; evaluate feasibility before committing to all items.

- Isometric service: #299 (isometric view), #322 (standalone package), #323 (HTTP wrapper),

- Embeddable: #1210 (Embeddable Rack Visualisations & GIS, XL/DEFER)

### M11 -- Internationalization (planned, 3 issues)

i18n support. Low priority until non-English users request it.

- #181 (Epic), #183 (language store), #184 (language selector)

### M12 -- Mobile & Touch UX (planned, 4 issues)

Mobile and touch-specific interactions.

- #1091 (touch listener hardening), #1052 (device library touch), #190 (long-press zoom),
  #359 (touch-accessible port overlays)

### M13 -- UX Polish & Accessibility (planned, 8 issues)
