# Spike #293: Isometric/3D View Research

**Issue:** #293 (parent: #289) **Time box:** 2-4 hours **Date:** 2025-12-30

## Research Question

How can we implement an isometric or 3D view of rack layouts, both in the live canvas and in exports (PNG/PDF)?

---

## Executive Summary

After researching CSS 3D transforms, export pipeline architecture, and isometric asset availability, I recommend **Approach B: Isometric Export Mode** as the most feasible path forward. CSS 3D transforms on a live canvas are technically possible but introduce significant UX complexity, while export-only isometric rendering is cleaner and more valuable for the "shareable rack diagram" use case.

---

## 1. CSS 3D Transform Approach

### How It Works

CSS 3D transforms can create an isometric projection using combinations of:

```css
.isometric-view {
  perspective: 8000px; /* Almost-isometric with slight natural distortion */
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.rack-container {
  transform: rotateX(60deg) rotateZ(-45deg);
  /* or: rotateX(65deg) rotate(45deg) for classic isometric */
}
```

**Key properties:**

- `perspective`: Creates depth; larger values = more isometric (less vanishing point)
- `rotateX()`: Tilts toward/away from viewer
- `rotateZ()`: Rotates in the XY plane
- `preserve-3d`: Ensures children maintain 3D positioning

### Current Architecture Impact

**Rackula's rendering:**

1. Canvas uses SVG (`Rack.svelte`) with internal `<g transform="translate()">` for positioning
2. Export builds SVG programmatically in `export.ts`, converts to canvas, then to PNG/PDF
3. **No html2canvas** - uses native Canvas API to rasterize SVG

**Critical finding:** CSS transforms applied to an HTML wrapper around the SVG would NOT affect the exported image because:

- Export generates a fresh SVG from scratch (not from DOM)
- The `svgToCanvas()` function draws the SVG directly, ignoring parent CSS

### Canvas (Live View) Feasibility

| Aspect | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Visual rendering | **Possible** - CSS transforms on wrapper work |
| Device interaction | **Problematic** - Click coordinates need inverse transform math |
| Drag-and-drop | **Complex** - Needs coordinate space conversion for placement |
| Pan/zoom | **Tricky** - panzoom library may conflict with 3D transforms |
| Performance | **Good** - CSS transforms are GPU-accelerated |

**Effort estimate:** Medium-High (2-3 days) to get basic display, additional work for interactions.

### Export Feasibility

| Aspect                  | Assessment                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| html2canvas             | **Does NOT support** CSS 3D transforms properly   |
| Native SVG→Canvas       | **Won't capture** CSS transforms on wrapper       |
| Server-side (Puppeteer) | **Would work** but requires server infrastructure |

**Conclusion:** CSS 3D transforms are NOT viable for current export pipeline without architectural changes.

---

## 2. Isometric Device Images Approach

### Concept

Instead of CSS transforms, render devices using pre-made isometric artwork:

- Each device type has an isometric PNG/SVG variant
- Export builds an isometric composition by positioning these assets

### Asset Availability

Isometric server/network assets are available from:

- [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/free-png/isometric-server) - 686+ free isometric server PNGs
- [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/icons/server-rack?styles%5B%5D=isometric) - 1,743 isometric rack icons (SVG/PNG)
- [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/isometric-server-rack) - Various isometric rack graphics

### Implementation Approach

1. Create isometric rack frame template (or generate via CSS transform + snapshot)
2. Map device positions to isometric coordinates
3. Stack isometric device images at correct positions
4. Generate composite image

### Trade-offs

| Aspect         | Assessment                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual quality | **High** - Hand-crafted assets look polished          |
| Custom devices | **Problem** - How do we render user-created devices?  |
| Maintenance    | **Ongoing** - Need isometric variant for every device |
| Bundle size    | **Impact** - Additional image assets                  |
| Consistency    | **Challenge** - Matching art style across sources     |

**Effort estimate:** High (1+ week) to build comprehensive isometric asset library.

---

## 3. Hybrid Approach: CSS Transform for Export Image Generation

### Concept

Use CSS 3D transforms with a **server-side or headless browser snapshot**:

1. Render the rack SVG in a hidden DOM element with CSS transforms
2. Use Puppeteer/Playwright to screenshot the transformed view
3. Return as PNG

### Feasibility

**Option A: Client-side with OffscreenCanvas** (experimental)

- Apply CSS transforms to a temporary DOM element
- Use experimental APIs to capture
- **Status:** Not reliable across browsers

**Option B: Server-side Puppeteer**

- Requires backend server infrastructure
- Rackula is currently client-only (GitHub Pages)
- Would need Cloudflare Worker, Vercel Function, or similar
- **Status:** Possible but architectural change

**Option C: Pre-generate on build**

- Not applicable - racks are user-generated at runtime

---

## 4. Alternative: SVG Skew/Transform in Export

### Concept

Apply SVG transforms directly in the `generateExportSVG()` function:

```xml
<svg viewBox="0 0 500 600">
  <g transform="matrix(0.866, 0.5, -0.866, 0.5, 300, 0)">
    <!-- rack content -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

### Feasibility

**Isometric projection matrix:**

- True isometric uses specific skew angles (30°)
- SVG `matrix()` transform can achieve this
- Works directly in export without html2canvas

### Prototype Transform

```javascript
// Isometric projection via SVG matrix
// Angles: 30° from horizontal for both axes
const cos30 = Math.cos(Math.PI / 6); // 0.866
const sin30 = Math.sin(Math.PI / 6); // 0.5

// SVG transform matrix: matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)
// For isometric: matrix(cos30, sin30, -cos30, sin30, tx, ty)
const isoTransform = `matrix(0.866, 0.5, -0.866, 0.5, ${offsetX}, ${offsetY})`;
```

### Assessment

| Aspect         | Assessment                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual result  | **Good** - Proper isometric projection            |
| Export support | **Yes** - SVG transforms are rasterized correctly |
| Canvas display | **Possible** - Same transform in live Rack.svelte |
| Interactions   | **Still complex** - Coordinates need conversion   |
| Implementation | **Medium** - Modify generateExportSVG()           |

**Effort estimate:** Medium (1-2 days) for export, additional work for live canvas.

## 5. WebGL/Three.js (Stretch Goal)

### Assessment

| Aspect         | Assessment                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Visual quality | **Excellent** - True 3D with lighting, shadows |
| Bundle impact  | **Large** - Three.js is ~150KB gzipped         |
| Learning curve | **High** - Different paradigm than SVG         |
| Export         | **Complex** - Need to render WebGL to canvas   |
| Overkill?      | **Probably** - Racks are fundamentally 2D data |

**Recommendation:** Not worth pursuing for isometric view. Reserve for future "virtual datacenter walkthrough" feature if ever.

---

## Recommendations

### Recommended: Approach B - Export-Only Isometric Mode

**Implementation path:**

1. **Phase 1: SVG Transform Export** (1-2 days)
   - Add "Isometric" export option in ExportPanel
   - Modify `generateExportSVG()` to apply SVG matrix transform
   - Adjust viewBox dimensions for isometric layout
   - Add subtle drop shadow for depth perception

2. **Phase 2: Polish** (1 day)
   - Depth sorting (devices at higher U positions render "behind")
   - Optional: Device side panels (show depth with color gradient)
   - Consider adding floor/ground shadow

3. **Phase 3: Optional Live Canvas** (2-3 days, if demanded)
   - Add view toggle (Flat / Isometric)
   - Implement coordinate transform for interactions
   - May need to disable some interactions in isometric mode

### Why Not Live Canvas First?

1. **Primary use case is export** - Users want cool shareable images
2. **Interactions are complex** - Drag-drop in skewed space is confusing UX
3. **Export validates concept** - Test user interest before deeper investment

### Deferred: Isometric Device Assets

Not recommended for initial implementation because:

- Custom devices would look inconsistent
- Large asset maintenance burden
- SVG transform achieves 80% of visual goal

Could revisit for "premium" polished look if isometric export proves popular.

---

## Implementation Sketch

```typescript
// In export.ts

function applyIsometricTransform(svg: SVGElement, isIsometric: boolean): void {
  if (!isIsometric) return;

  const content = svg.querySelector(".export-content");
  if (!content) return;

  // Isometric projection matrix
  // 30° angles create true isometric view
  const cos30 = 0.866;
  const sin30 = 0.5;

  // Calculate offset to keep content visible after transform
  const bounds = content.getBoundingClientRect();
  const offsetX = bounds.height * cos30;
  const offsetY = 0;

  content.setAttribute(
    "transform",
    `matrix(${cos30}, ${sin30}, -${cos30}, ${sin30}, ${offsetX}, ${offsetY})`,
  );

  // Update viewBox to fit transformed content
  // ... viewBox calculation
}
```

---

## Design Decisions (Clarified)

1. **Dual-view (front+rear) in isometric?**
   - **Decision:** Toggle for front-only, rear-only, or both views
   - When "both" is selected, render two separate isometric views side-by-side
   - Matches current flat export behavior

2. **Half-depth devices?**
   - **Decision:** Yes, visually represent half-depth in isometric view
   - Half-depth devices should appear with less "thickness" in the isometric projection
   - This reinforces the mounted face concept and adds visual accuracy

3. **Legend placement?**
   - **Decision:** Keep legend flat (not transformed)
   - Place below the isometric rack(s)
   - Maintains readability and follows convention for technical diagrams

---

## Implementation Details & Edge Cases

### A. SVG Transform Mathematics

**Isometric projection matrix:**

```
True isometric: 30° angles from horizontal
- cos(30°) = 0.866025...
- sin(30°) = 0.5

SVG matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f) maps to:
  x' = a*x + c*y + e
  y' = b*x + d*y + f

For isometric: matrix(cos30, sin30, -cos30, sin30, tx, ty)
```

**ViewBox calculation after transform:**

```
Original dimensions: W × H
After isometric transform:
  New width  = W * cos30 + H * cos30 = (W + H) * 0.866
  New height = W * sin30 + H * sin30 = (W + H) * 0.5

Example: 220px × 968px rack (42U)
  Transformed width  = (220 + 968) * 0.866 ≈ 1029px
  Transformed height = (220 + 968) * 0.5   = 594px
```

**Transform origin:**

- SVG transforms apply from (0,0) by default
- Must translate content AFTER transform to position correctly
- Or wrap in group with pre-translation

**Decision needed:** Use true isometric (30°) or slightly adjusted angle for aesthetics?

---

### B. Device Depth Visualization

**Full-depth devices (is_full_depth: true or undefined):**

- Render front face (current rectangle)
- Add right-side panel to show depth
- Side panel width: ~20px in isometric space (representing ~24" physical depth)

**Half-depth devices (is_full_depth: false):**

- Same front face
- Side panel width: ~10px (half the depth)
- Visually distinguishes from full-depth

**Side panel rendering:**

```svg
<!-- Device front face (existing) -->
<rect x="..." y="..." width="186" height="44" fill="#3498db"/>

<!-- Device side panel (new for isometric) -->
<polygon points="x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 x4,y4" fill="#2980b9"/>
```

**Side panel color:**

- Darken device color by 20-25%
- Use HSL manipulation: reduce lightness by 20%
- Or multiply RGB by 0.8

**Decision needed:** Exact depth pixels? (suggests: full=20px, half=10px)

---

### C. Device Labels in Isometric

**Problem:** Text becomes skewed and hard to read in isometric projection.

**Options:**

1. **Omit labels in isometric** - Cleanest, rely on legend
2. **Counter-rotate labels** - Apply inverse transform to text only
3. **Callout lines** - Flat labels with lines pointing to devices

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (omit) for MVP, add callouts in polish phase if requested.

**Device images:**

- Currently rendered on device front faces
- In isometric: images would be skewed/distorted
- **Recommendation:** Fall back to category icons in isometric mode (simpler, consistent)

---

### D. Rack Frame 3D Representation

**Current flat rendering:**

- Rectangle for rail on each side
- Horizontal bars top and bottom
- Interior background color

**Isometric enhancement:**

- Render rack as 3D "box frame"
- Show: front rails, top bar, right side depth
- Creates visual context for devices

**Rack frame components:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐ ← Top bar (front edge)
│  ╱─────────────────╱│
│ ╱                 ╱ │ ← Top surface (subtle)
│╱_________________╱  │
│█               █│   │ ← Left rail │ Interior │ Right rail
│█               █│  ╱
│█               █│ ╱  ← Right side depth
│█_______________█│╱
└─────────────────────┘ ← Bottom bar
```

**Color scheme for frame:**

- Front rails: current rail color
- Top surface: slightly lighter
- Right side: slightly darker
- Floor shadow: subtle gray gradient below rack

**Decision needed:** How much visual complexity? (suggests: start simple, add top surface in polish)

---

### E. Dual-View Layout

**Front + Rear side-by-side:**

```
┌──────────────┐  GAP  ┌──────────────┐
│   FRONT      │  ←→   │    REAR      │
│   (depth     │       │   (depth     │
│   extends    │       │   extends    │
│   RIGHT)     │       │   LEFT)      │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

**Key considerations:**

- Front view: devices' depth extends to the RIGHT
- Rear view: devices' depth extends to the LEFT (mirrored)
- Gap between views: increase from 40px to ~60px to prevent overlap
- Both racks share same legend below

**Alternative layout:** Staggered (rear offset above-right of front)

- More compact but potentially confusing
- **Recommendation:** Keep side-by-side for consistency with flat export

---

### F. Half-Depth Device Special Cases

**Mounted face visualization:**

- Front-mounted device in front view: full visibility, normal depth
- Rear-mounted device in front view: show as "phantom" (reduced opacity) or hidden?

**Blocked slots:**

- When half-depth device on one face blocks placement on other face
- Current flat export: diagonal stripes
- Isometric: could show blocked area as crosshatched depth region

**Decision needed:** Show rear-mounted devices in front view? (suggests: no, keep clean)

---

### G. Export Format Considerations

**PNG/JPEG:**

- SVG transforms rasterize correctly to canvas
- Consider higher default resolution (2x) for isometric due to diagonal aliasing
- May need anti-aliasing hints

**PDF:**

- SVG embedded in jsPDF preserves transforms
- Page orientation: landscape likely better for wide isometric layout
- Test page size calculations with transformed dimensions

**SVG export:**

- Transform matrix preserved in output
- Compatible with all modern tools (Figma, Illustrator, browsers)
- File size similar to flat (no bitmap data)

**Filename convention:**

- Append `-isometric` to export filename
- e.g., `my-rack-2025-12-30-isometric.png`

---

### H. Edge Cases Checklist

| Scenario | Consideration | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Empty rack** | Rack frame only, no devices | Should still render 3D frame correctly |
| **Single 1U device** | Very small visual | Renders fine, legend provides context |
| **42U fully populated** | Many overlapping side panels | Depth sorting ensures correct overlap |
| **0.5U device** | Very thin (11px height) | May need minimum visual height for side panel |
| **Custom devices** | No images, only colors | Works same as library devices (color rectangle) |
| **Device images** | Would be distorted | Fall back to category icons in isometric mode |
| **10" rack** | Narrower (116px) | Isometric proportions scale down correctly |
| **Mixed half/full depth** | Adjacent devices with different depths | Each device renders its own depth independently |
| **Device at U1** | Bottom of rack | Side panel may extend below rack frame—clip to rack bounds |
| **Device at U42** | Top of rack | Side panel must not exceed top bar |

---

### I. UI/UX Specifications

**Export panel additions:**

```
View Style
○ Flat (current)
● Isometric

[existing export options...]
```

- Radio buttons or toggle switch
- Default: Flat (preserve existing behavior)
- Remember preference in localStorage? (suggest: yes)

**Preview:**

- No live preview in export panel (too complex)
- User clicks "Export" and sees result
- Could add small static icon showing flat vs isometric

---

### J. Performance Considerations

**SVG complexity increase:**

- Each device adds 1 additional polygon (side panel)
- 42 devices → 42 extra shapes
- Negligible impact on modern devices

**Canvas conversion:**

- Larger viewBox dimensions due to isometric projection
- ~1.7x larger canvas area
- May need to cap maximum resolution for very large exports

**Batch rendering:**

- Export is one-shot operation
- No real-time rendering concerns
- Memory usage scales with device count (acceptable)

---

### K. Testing Strategy

**Unit tests:**

- [ ] Isometric transform matrix calculation
- [ ] ViewBox dimension calculation for various rack sizes
- [ ] Side panel color darkening algorithm
- [ ] Depth sorting logic (higher U = rendered first)

**Integration tests:**

- [ ] Export generates valid SVG with transform attribute
- [ ] PNG export produces correct dimensions
- [ ] PDF export fits on page with correct orientation

**Visual regression tests:**

- [ ] Create golden images for reference configurations:
  - Empty 12U rack
  - 42U with mixed devices
  - Dual-view front+rear
  - Half-depth device at various positions
- [ ] Compare against snapshots after code changes

**Manual testing checklist:**

- [ ] All export formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG)
- [ ] Both themes (light/dark background)
- [ ] 10" and 19" rack widths
- [ ] Device library items with images
- [ ] Custom user-created devices
- [ ] QR code positioning in isometric
- [ ] Legend readability

---

---

### M. Open Technical Questions

1. **Exact transform values:** True isometric (30°) or adjusted for rack proportions?
2. **Side panel pixel depth:** 20px full, 10px half—or proportional to rack width?
3. **Transform application point:** Before or after legend generation?
4. **QR code positioning:** Keep in corner, or move to avoid overlap with isometric rack?
5. **Airflow indicators:** Skip in isometric, or attempt to render arrows?
