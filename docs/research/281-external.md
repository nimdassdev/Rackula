## Fuzzy Search Algorithms

### Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)

The classic fuzzy matching algorithm measuring the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform one string into another.

**Operations counted:**

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Substitution

**Example:** "kitten" -> "sitting" = 3 edits

1. k -> s (substitution)
2. e -> i (substitution)
3. - g (insertion)

**Use cases:** Spell checking, typo correction, general fuzzy matching

**Performance:** O(m\*n) where m and n are string lengths. Computationally expensive for long strings or large datasets.

**Libraries using it:** Fuse.js (as part of Bitap), Lunr.js (fuzzy modifier)

### Damerau-Levenshtein Distance

Extension of Levenshtein that also counts transpositions (adjacent character swaps) as a single edit.

**Example:** "recieve" -> "receive" = 1 edit (transposition of 'ie')

**Use cases:** Better for typos where users swap adjacent keys

### Jaro-Winkler Similarity

A similarity metric (0-1 scale) that weights matching characters and transpositions, with extra weight for matching prefixes.

**Key characteristics:**

- Returns similarity score (higher = more similar)
- Prioritizes prefix matches
- Faster than Levenshtein for single-word comparisons
- 80% threshold commonly used for "match"

**Formula considerations:**

- Matching characters (within a window)
- Transpositions
- Common prefix length (up to 4 chars)

**Use cases:** Name matching, deduplication, short string comparison

**When to prefer over Levenshtein:**

- Single word comparisons
- When prefix similarity matters
- Performance-critical applications

### N-gram (Q-gram) Matching

Breaks strings into overlapping substrings of length N, then compares the sets.

**Example (n=2, bigrams):** "hello" -> ["he", "el", "ll", "lo"]

**Advantages:**

- Off-line algorithm (can be pre-indexed)
- Fast for large datasets
- Works well with TF-IDF vectorization
- Catches partial matches

**Disadvantages:**

- One-character n-grams match too broadly
- Long n-grams miss short misspellings

**Best practices:**

- Use n=2 or n=3 (bigrams/trigrams)
- Combine with other metrics for refinement
- Consider TF-IDF weighting for relevance

**Libraries using it:** FlexSearch (tokenizer), MiniSearch (optional)

### Bitap Algorithm (Shift-Or)

Used by Fuse.js - a fuzzy string matching algorithm using bitwise operations.

**Characteristics:**

- On-line algorithm (no pre-indexing needed)
- Efficient for short patterns
- Supports approximate matching with configurable error threshold

## Multi-Field Weighted Search

### Fuse.js Implementation

```javascript
const options = {
  includeScore: true,
  includeMatches: true,
  threshold: 0.4, // 0.0 = exact, 1.0 = match anything
  ignoreLocation: true, // search anywhere in field
  keys: [
    { name: "name", weight: 3 },
    { name: "manufacturer", weight: 2 },
    { name: "model", weight: 2 },
    { name: "category", weight: 1.5 },
    { name: "description", weight: 1 },
  ],
};

const fuse = new Fuse(deviceLibrary, options);
const results = fuse.search("cisco switch");
// Results sorted by combined weighted score
```

### MiniSearch Implementation

```javascript
const miniSearch = new MiniSearch({
  fields: ["name", "manufacturer", "model", "description"],
  storeFields: ["name", "manufacturer", "u_height", "form_factor"],
  searchOptions: {
    boost: { name: 3, manufacturer: 2, model: 2 },
    fuzzy: 0.2,
    prefix: true,
    weights: {
      fuzzy: 0.45, // weight for fuzzy matches
      prefix: 0.375, // weight for prefix matches
    },
  },
});

// Document-level boosting
miniSearch.search("cisco", {
  boostDocument: (id, term, storedFields) => {
    // Boost recently added devices
    return storedFields.isPopular ? 1.5 : 1;
  },
});
```

### Lunr.js Implementation

```javascript
const idx = lunr(function () {
  this.ref("id");
  this.field("name", { boost: 10 });
  this.field("manufacturer", { boost: 5 });
  this.field("model", { boost: 5 });
  this.field("description");

  devices.forEach((device) => this.add(device));
});

// Query-time boosting
idx.search("name:cisco^10 switch");
```

### Best Practices for Device Search Weighting

| Field | Recommended Weight | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` / `model` | 3-4x | Primary identifier, users search by name first |
| `manufacturer` | 2-3x | Often part of mental model ("Cisco switch") |
| `category` | 1.5-2x | Helps when browsing by type |
| `description` | 1x | Supporting info, lower priority |
| `tags` / `keywords` | 2x | Intentionally added for discoverability |

## Similar Tools: How They Handle Device Search

### NetBox

The leading open-source DCIM solution uses a hybrid approach:

**Global Search:**

- Indexes relevant fields by precedence
- Real-time index updates on create/modify
- Supports exact match, partial match lookup types
- Highlights matching portions in results

**Device Filtering (API/UI):**

```python
# Filters on: name, serial, asset_tag, comments, primary_ip
queryset.filter(
    Q(name__icontains=value) |
    Q(serial__icontains=value) |
    Q(asset_tag__icontains=value) |
    Q(comments__icontains=value) |
    Q(primary_ip4__address__startswith=value)
).distinct()
```

**REST API:** Supports filtering with lookup expressions (`__n` for negation, `__ic` for case-insensitive contains)

### RackTables

- **Tag-based filtering** as primary navigation method
- **RackCode filter expressions** for complex queries
- Hierarchical tag support (e.g., room -> building)
- Search redirects to single match if FQDN matches search domain

### Device42

- Intelligent search across IP, MAC, gateway addresses
- Custom field support for extended search
- Barcode/QR code asset tagging
- Search includes rack diagrams and asset views

### Rack Track

- Full-text search across all asset attributes
- Saved search/filter presets per user role
- Cross-references network topology in search

### Common Patterns Across Tools

1. **Multi-field search** with field-specific weights
2. **Typeahead/autocomplete** for real-time feedback
3. **Filter chips/badges** for refining results
4. **Category facets** for browsing
5. **Recent/popular items** prominently displayed
6. **Saved searches** for power users

---

## Best Practices

### Autocomplete/Typeahead UX

1. **Start suggestions immediately** (first character)
   - Don't wait for 2-3 characters
   - Shows users the feature exists
   - Use popular/frequent items as initial suggestions

2. **Limit suggestion count**
   - Desktop: 8-10 items maximum
   - Mobile: 6-8 items maximum
   - Choice paralysis occurs with more

3. **Highlight matched portions**
   - Highlight the suggested text (not what user typed)
   - Helps users quickly scan and decide

4. **Support keyboard navigation**
   - Up/Down arrows to navigate
   - Enter to select
   - Escape to dismiss
   - Follow WAI-ARIA Combobox pattern

5. **Mobile considerations**
   - Adequate touch target sizes (44px minimum)
   - Disable browser autocomplete/autocorrect
   - Consider "tap-ahead" chips for query building

### Performance Optimization

1. **Debounce input**

   ```javascript
   // Debounce search to prevent lag on every keystroke
   let timeout;
   function handleSearch(query) {
     clearTimeout(timeout);
     timeout = setTimeout(() => search(query), 150);
   }
   ```

2. **Pre-build indexes** when possible
   - Build at compile/deploy time for static data
   - Lazy-load index on first search interaction
   - Cache index in localStorage/IndexedDB

3. **Lazy-load search library**
   - Import dynamically when search is used
   - Reduces initial bundle size

   ```javascript
   const Fuse = await import("fuse.js");
   ```

4. **Consider dataset size** | Dataset Size | Recommended Approach | |-------------|---------------------| | < 100 items | Any library works; Fuse.js simplest | | 100-1000 | Fuse.js or MiniSearch | | 1000-10000 | MiniSearch or FlexSearch | | > 10000 | FlexSearch with workers, or server-side |

5. **Disable unused features**
   - Turn off TF-IDF if simple matching suffices
   - Skip stemming for technical terms
   - Use simpler tokenizers when possible

### Search Quality

1. **Combine algorithms** for best results
   - Primary: Fuzzy matching (typos)
   - Secondary: Prefix matching (autocomplete)
   - Tertiary: Exact matching boost

2. **Handle common issues**
   - Normalize case and diacritics
   - Handle manufacturer abbreviations (HP = Hewlett-Packard)
   - Consider synonyms (switch, network switch)

3. **Zero results handling**
   - Show "Did you mean...?" suggestions
   - Offer category browse as fallback
   - Log queries for future improvements

- Want fastest possible performance

### Configuration Template for Rackula

```javascript
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

const searchOptions = {
  includeScore: true,
  includeMatches: true,    // for highlighting
  threshold: 0.4,
  ignoreLocation: true,
  minMatchCharLength: 2,
  keys: [
    { name: 'name', weight: 3 },
    { name: 'manufacturer', weight: 2 },
    { name: 'model', weight: 2 },
    { name: 'category', weight: 1.5 },
    { name: 'description', weight: 1 }
  ]
};

// Create search instance
const deviceSearch = new Fuse(deviceLibrary, searchOptions);

// Search with debouncing
function searchDevices(query: string) {
  if (!query || query.length < 1) {
    return deviceLibrary;  // Show all when empty
  }
  return deviceSearch.search(query).map(result => result.item);
}
```
