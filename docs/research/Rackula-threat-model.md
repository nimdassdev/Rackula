## Executive summary

Rackula’s highest practical risks are unauthorized data mutation and service disruption in persistence-enabled deployments, especially where the dev environment is internet-exposed and API auth is intentionally absent. The API has strong input/path validation and size limits, but it currently relies on network placement and reverse-proxy controls for security boundaries; without those controls, integrity and availability risks dominate over confidentiality (which is low-sensitivity by context).

## Hardening baseline status (2026-06-04)

This model was written against the pre-hardening API. The self-hosted hardening baseline (epic #1274) is now implemented, so the per-boundary "Rate limiting: none" notes and the unmitigated origin and storage gaps in the threat table below describe the prior state. Current mitigations, on by default:

- Write-route and read-route rate limiting (#1778): in-app per-IP limits (writes 30 per 60s, reads 120 per 60s by default), returning HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`. Mitigates the availability/abuse paths flagged as "Rate limiting: none" across TB-1 through TB-5 and abuse path 3.
- Mutating-request origin policy (#1779): trusted `Origin`/`Referer` required on state-changing requests, rejected with HTTP 403. Mitigates the cross-origin drive-by write path (TM-002). Active only when auth and CSRF protection are enabled; a valid write token bypasses it for non-browser clients.
- Storage quotas (#1780): default caps of 100 layouts and 50 assets per layout, returning HTTP 429/507. Mitigates the storage-exhaustion path (TB-4, TM-003).

Residual risk after hardening: rate limiting is skipped when the client IP cannot be determined (untrusted proxy headers), and limits are per-IP (shared-NAT clients share a budget); the origin policy is not enforced in auth-less or wildcard-CORS deployments, which still rely on network placement plus the optional write token; quota checks are not atomic with writes (a small concurrent-overshoot window, accepted for low-concurrency homelab use). See `docs/deployment/SELF-HOSTING.md` for operator configuration.

## Scope and assumptions

- In scope paths: `src/` (SPA runtime), `api/src/` (persistence API), `deploy/` + `docker-compose.yml` + `deploy/docker-compose.persist.yml` (runtime deployment), `.github/workflows/` (build/release supply chain).
- Out of scope: `e2e/`, `src/tests/`, `docs/research/`, local dev convenience scripts unless they directly affect runtime or release integrity.
- User-validated context (February 6, 2026): Internal self-hosted usage, dev deployment may be internet exposed, no auth, low data sensitivity.
- Assumptions used for ranking: Reverse-proxy/TLS setup varies by operator, API may be reachable by unauthorized parties in some environments, and multi-user controls are intentionally absent.
- Open questions that could materially change ranking: Whether internet-exposed dev has IP allowlisting/WAF, whether backups are immutable/versioned, and whether any proxy-level auth will be added.
- Quality check status: All discovered entry points are covered, each trust boundary is represented in at least one threat, runtime and CI/dev are separated, user clarifications are integrated, and assumptions/open questions are explicit.

## System model

### Primary components

- Browser SPA (Svelte/TypeScript) handling layout editing, share-link decode, archive import/export, and autosave. Evidence: `src/App.svelte` (`onMount`, `handleLoad`, autosave effects), `src/lib/utils/share.ts`, `src/lib/utils/archive.ts`.
- Nginx frontend container serving static assets and proxying `/api/*` to sidecar API. Evidence: `deploy/nginx.conf.template` (`location /api/`, `/api/health`), `deploy/Dockerfile`.
- Bun/Hono persistence API sidecar exposing layout and asset CRUD and writing to `/data`. Evidence: `api/src/index.ts`, `api/src/routes/layouts.ts`, `api/src/routes/assets.ts`, `api/src/storage/filesystem.ts`, `api/src/storage/assets.ts`.
- Shared persistent volume storing YAML and uploaded images. Evidence: `api/src/storage/filesystem.ts`, `api/src/storage/assets.ts`, `docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/docker-compose.persist.yml`.
- CI/CD and image delivery pipeline (GitHub Actions -> GHCR -> VPS deploy). Evidence: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

### Data flows and trust boundaries

- TB-1: User Browser -> SPA (`GET /`, JS bundles, URL query string `?l=...`). Data: share payload, user edits, local autosave state. Channel: HTTPS/HTTP. Security guarantees: CSP/HSTS/XFO/XCTO headers when deployed with provided nginx config. Validation: share payload decoded then validated via `MinimalLayoutSchema`. Rate limiting: none. Evidence: `src/App.svelte` (`getShareParam`, `decodeLayout`), `src/lib/utils/share.ts`, `deploy/security-headers.conf`.
- TB-2: User Local Files -> SPA import parsers (`.zip`, `.yaml`, `.json`). Data: archives, NetBox YAML, device-library JSON. Channel: browser file picker / local file APIs. Security guarantees: type constraints and schema validation in code. Validation: archive parsing + layout schema validation, NetBox required-field checks, JSON device validation. Rate limiting: no explicit uncompressed-size/entry-count limits. Evidence: `src/lib/utils/file.ts`, `src/lib/utils/archive.ts`, `src/lib/utils/yaml.ts`, `src/lib/utils/netbox-import.ts`, `src/lib/utils/import.ts`.
- TB-3: Browser -> API via nginx `/api/*`. Data: layout YAML, image blobs, metadata, delete/list operations. Channel: HTTP proxied inside container network. Security guarantees: body limits, UUID/slug/face validation, content-type checks. Validation: Zod schemas and path sanitization. Rate limiting: none by default. Evidence: `deploy/nginx.conf.template`, `api/src/index.ts`, `api/src/routes/layouts.ts`, `api/src/routes/assets.ts`.
- TB-4: API -> Filesystem volume `/data`. Data: YAML files, assets, folder names with UUID suffix. Channel: local filesystem calls. Security guarantees: UUID checks, slug/path sanitization, atomic write for assets. Validation: `isUuid`, `sanitizeForPath`, regex constraints. Rate limiting: none; bounded only by storage capacity. Evidence: `api/src/storage/filesystem.ts`, `api/src/storage/assets.ts`, `api/src/schemas/layout.ts`.
- TB-5: External websites -> Browser-initiated cross-origin requests to API. Data: unauthenticated API calls from arbitrary origins where reachable. Channel: browser fetch/CORS. Security guarantees: optional `CORS_ORIGIN`; default wildcard. Validation: route-level param/body checks. Rate limiting: none. Evidence: `api/src/index.ts` (`origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || "*"`, production warning log).
- TB-6: CI/CD -> GHCR -> Self-hosted runtime. Data: container images and release artifacts. Channel: GitHub Actions, registry pull, docker compose deploy. Security guarantees: action SHA pinning, CodeQL workflow present. Validation: changelog validation for tagged release, but no runtime image signature verification in deploy workflow. Evidence: `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`, `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Assets and security objectives

| Asset | Why it matters | Security objective (C/I/A) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout YAML and metadata (`name`, device placement, notes/custom fields) | Integrity loss breaks planning docs; exposure can reveal internal infrastructure naming/details | I > A > C |
| Uploaded device images | Tampering can mislead operators; large volume can consume storage | I, A |
| Persistence API availability | Save/load outages directly break core self-hosted persistence workflow | A, I |
| Data volume capacity (`/data`) | Exhaustion causes write failures and possible broader host instability | A |
| Container images and deployment workflow | Compromise can ship malicious runtime behavior to dev/prod | I, A |
| Local browser autosave/share payload state | Corruption can cause user data loss or client-side denial of use | I, A |

## Attacker model

### Capabilities

- Remote internet attacker can reach internet-exposed dev endpoints and call unauthenticated API routes directly.
- Internal network attacker (or compromised host) can reach self-hosted services and mutate shared layouts.
- Malicious web page can trigger cross-origin API requests from a victim browser when API is reachable and CORS is permissive.
- Social engineering attacker can send crafted share links or archives to trigger client-side parsing/decompression pressure.
- Supply-chain attacker with CI/workflow/release foothold can influence shipped images.

### Non-capabilities

- No assumption of attacker access to host root/shell by default.
- No assumption of high-value regulated data in layouts (user confirmed low sensitivity), reducing confidentiality impact tiers.
- No direct server-side code execution through YAML object tags in current parser mode (`JSON_SCHEMA` used server-side).
- No assumption that browser storage attacks cross user/browser boundaries; localStorage/sessionStorage scope remains same-origin.

## Entry points and attack surfaces

| Surface | How reached | Trust boundary | Notes | Evidence (repo path / symbol) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/layouts` and `GET /api/layouts/:uuid` | Browser or direct HTTP client | TB-3 | Enumerates and reads saved layouts without app auth | `api/src/routes/layouts.ts` (`layouts.get`) |
| `PUT /api/layouts/:uuid` | Browser autosave/manual client | TB-3 | Writes YAML; UUID and schema checks exist but no auth/rate limit | `api/src/routes/layouts.ts` (`layouts.put`), `api/src/index.ts` |
| `DELETE /api/layouts/:uuid` | Browser/manual client | TB-3 | Deletes layout folders; no ownership model | `api/src/routes/layouts.ts` (`layouts.delete`) |
| `PUT /api/assets/:layoutId/:deviceSlug/:face` | Browser/manual client | TB-3 | 5MB limit and content-type checks; unauthenticated write | `api/src/routes/assets.ts` (`assets.put`) |
| API CORS policy | Any origin by default | TB-5 | `*` default enables cross-origin browser invocation when reachable | `api/src/index.ts` (`cors` config) |
| Share parameter `?l=` decode path | Visiting crafted URL | TB-1 | Inflates/decompresses user-controlled payload in browser | `src/App.svelte` (`decodeLayout` on mount), `src/lib/utils/share.ts` |
| Archive import (`.zip`) | Local file load | TB-2 | Parses zip and nested files; no explicit uncompressed byte/entry cap | `src/lib/utils/file.ts`, `src/lib/utils/archive.ts` |
| NetBox YAML import dialog | Local YAML file or text | TB-2 | YAML parse + field checks; could be large/complex input | `src/lib/components/ImportFromNetBoxDialog.svelte`, `src/lib/utils/netbox-import.ts` |
| Device library JSON import | Local JSON file | TB-2 | File text parsed and validated, duplicate slug handling | `src/App.svelte` (`handleDeviceImportFileChange`), `src/lib/utils/import.ts` |
| Dynamic analytics script load | Build/runtime config | TB-6 | Script src from build vars; CSP constrains allowed source in nginx deployments | `src/lib/utils/analytics.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `deploy/security-headers.conf` |

## Top abuse paths

1. Goal: Unauthorized modification/deletion of persisted layouts. Steps: Discover exposed `/api` endpoint -> call `PUT/DELETE /api/layouts/:uuid` without credentials -> overwrite or remove data -> users load tampered/missing layouts. Impact: Integrity and availability loss for shared instance.
2. Goal: Drive-by cross-origin write abuse against internal users. Steps: Host malicious webpage -> victim on internal network visits page -> page issues fetch requests to reachable Rackula API (CORS wildcard) -> silent mutations/deletes occur. Impact: Integrity loss without attacker needing direct network foothold.
3. Goal: Exhaust API storage and degrade service. Steps: Script repeated valid `PUT /api/assets` uploads and layout writes -> consume `/data` volume -> writes fail and persistence becomes unreliable/unavailable. Impact: Availability degradation and potential host-side operational impact.
4. Goal: Force client denial-of-service via import/share parsing. Steps: Send oversized/crafted `.zip` or very large compressed share payload -> user opens/imports -> JSZip/pako inflate and parsing consume CPU/memory -> UI freezes/crashes. Impact: User-level availability and potential data-loss frustration.
5. Goal: Recon internal topology metadata from exposed dev instance. Steps: Query `GET /api/layouts` -> fetch layout YAML by UUID -> extract names/notes/asset references -> map environment details. Impact: Low-to-medium confidentiality exposure, supports follow-on attacks.
6. Goal: Malicious runtime deployment through CI/CD compromise. Steps: Compromise release/tag/workflow or dependency in build path -> publish/pull malicious image -> self-host deploy updates containers. Impact: High integrity impact on runtime if supply chain is compromised.

## Criticality calibration

- `critical` for this repo/context: Pre-auth remote code execution in API runtime, or supply-chain compromise that ships attacker code broadly without detection. Cross-environment compromise (dev to prod) through shared secrets/runner trust.
- `high` for this repo/context: Unauthorized write/delete of persisted layouts in reachable deployments (`/api/layouts`, `/api/assets`). Sustained API/storage exhaustion that makes persistence unusable. Malicious image deployment path compromise with realistic trigger.
- `medium` for this repo/context: Cross-origin drive-by API mutation requiring victim browser/network reachability. Client-side DoS via crafted share links/archives that impacts availability but not server integrity. Enumeration of low-sensitivity infrastructure metadata from exposed dev.
- `low` for this repo/context: Noisy scanning that does not bypass existing validation. Non-persistent local UI disruption requiring unusual user action and easy recovery. Analytics-related visibility issues without direct security impact.
