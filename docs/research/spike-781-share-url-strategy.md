# Spike #781: Share URL Strategy for Multi-Rack Layouts

**Date:** 2026-01-20 **Parent Epic:** #150 (Multi-rack support) **Blocked Issue:** #780 (Multi-rack share/export implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

This spike investigated how to extend Rackula's share URL system to support multi-rack layouts while maintaining reliability, privacy, and offline capability.

**Key Findings:**

1. Multi-rack layouts will quickly exceed URL length limits (~2,000 chars)
2. Switching from pako to lz-string provides ~5-10% better compression and 25KB smaller bundle
3. A hybrid approach (direct URL for small layouts, shortener for large) balances simplicity with capability
4. Cloudflare Workers + KV is the recommended shortener infrastructure (free tier sufficient)

**Recommendation:** Implement hybrid approach in three phases:

- Phase 1: lz-string compression migration
- Phase 2: Multi-rack schema extension
- Phase 3: Cloudflare shortener for large layouts

## Investigation Results

### 1. URL Size Measurements & Projections

| Configuration | Racks | Devices/Rack | Device Types | Est. URL Size | QR Fit? | Browser Safe? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Empty rack | 1 | 0 | 0 | ~200 chars | ✅ | ✅ |
| Typical homelab | 1 | 15 | 5 | ~800 chars | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dense single rack | 1 | 30 | 10 | ~1,500 chars | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Light 2-rack | 2 | 5 | 5 | ~900 chars | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Medium 2-rack** | **2** | **15** | **8** | **~1,600 chars** | **⚠️** | **✅** |
| Dense 2-rack | 2 | 25 | 12 | ~2,400 chars | ❌ | ❌ |
| Medium 3-rack | 3 | 15 | 10 | ~2,200 chars | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| 5-rack homelab | 5 | 10 | 12 | ~2,800 chars | ❌ | ❌ |

**Key Insight:** Device types dominate URL size (~80 chars each). Homelabbers with diverse gear hit limits faster than users with homogeneous equipment.

### 2. The "Cliff" Points

| Limit | Characters | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **QR Code (Version 24, EC-L)** | 1,588 | QR codes become impractical to scan |
| **Browser URL (Edge)** | 2,083 | URLs truncated in address bar |
| **Bitly input limit** | 2,048 | Third-party shorteners refuse the URL |
| **nginx default** | 4,096 | Server-side truncation risk |

**Practical ceiling for URL-only sharing:** ~1,800 characters (with headroom)

### 3. Compression Options Evaluated

| Algorithm | Compression Ratio | Bundle Size | URL-Safe Output | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **lz-string** | 88% | ~1KB | ✅ Native | **Recommended** |
| pako (current) | 82% | ~26KB | ❌ Needs base64url | Replace |
| LZMA-JS | 85%+ | ~9KB | ❌ | Overkill |
| Brotli WASM | 90%+ | ~681KB | ❌ | Too heavy |

**Migration benefit:** ~25KB bundle reduction + simpler code + better compression

### 4. Industry Practices

| Tool | Approach | URL Length | Server Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| draw.io | Compressed XML in URL | Variable (has limits) | No |
| Excalidraw | E2E encrypted server storage | Short | Yes |
| Figma | Server-stored with permissions | Short | Yes |
| Compiler Explorer | Own shortener (after goo.gl sunset) | Short | Yes |
| **Rackula (proposed)** | **Hybrid: URL + optional shortener** | **Variable** | **Optional** |

**Lesson from Compiler Explorer:** "Never trust a third-party service with your core infrastructure"

### 5. Serverless Shortener Options

| Service | Free Tier | Cold Starts | Complexity | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloudflare KV** | 100K reads/day | None | Low | **Recommended** |
| Vercel KV | 30K/month | Minimal | Low | Viable alternative |
| Supabase | 500MB (pauses) | Yes | Medium | Not suitable |
| Firebase | 1GB | Minimal | Medium | Overkill |

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### Decision Flow

```
User clicks "Share"
    │
    ▼
Encode layout with lz-string
    │
    ▼
URL length < 1,800 chars?
    │
   YES ──► Use direct URL
    │       • Copy URL to clipboard
    │       • Generate QR code directly
    │       • No server dependency
    │
   NO ───► Offer options:
            • "Create short URL" (via Cloudflare)
            • "Download .rackula file" (offline)
            • Show length warning
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: lz-string Migration (v0.7.0-alpha)

**Scope:**

- Replace pako with lz-string
- Add backward compatibility for existing share URLs (v1 format)
- Update ShareDialog to show URL length warning
- Add "Download layout file" as fallback

**Effort:** 2-4 hours

#### Phase 2: Multi-Rack Schema (v0.7.0-beta)

**Schema Change:**

```typescript
// v1 (current)
{ v: "1", n: "name", r: MinimalRack, dt: DeviceType[] }

// v2 (proposed)
{ v: "2", n: "name", rs: MinimalRack[], rg?: RackGroup[], dt: DeviceType[] }
```

**Scope:**

- Extend MinimalLayout for multiple racks
- Add rack groups encoding (bayed configurations)
- Handle container_id/slot_id for nested devices
- Maintain v1 backward compatibility

**Effort:** 4-8 hours

#### Phase 3: Cloudflare Shortener (v0.7.0)

**Infrastructure:**

- Domain: `s.racku.la` (or `l.racku.la`)
- Worker: Cloudflare Workers (free tier)
- Storage: Cloudflare KV (1-year TTL on short URLs)

**Scope:**

- Set up Cloudflare Worker
- Add shortener API call to ShareDialog
- Implement threshold-based decision (1,800 char cutoff)
- Generate QR codes from short URLs for large layouts

**Effort:** 8-16 hours

### Total Effort: 14-28 hours

## What to Defer (Future Work)

| Feature | Reason | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connections/cables in share format | Cable management not complete | After cable feature |
| E2E encrypted storage | Only needed for collaboration | v1.0+ |
| API rate limiting | Only if abuse occurs | As needed |
| Settings preservation | Low user impact | If requested |

---

## Trade-offs Accepted

1. **Privacy trade-off:** Large layouts stored in Cloudflare KV (not E2E encrypted)
   - Mitigation: Data not public, only accessible via short URL
   - Users wanting privacy can use file export

2. **Offline trade-off:** Large layouts require network for shortener
   - Mitigation: File export always works offline
   - Direct URLs work offline for small layouts

3. **Complexity trade-off:** Three-phase implementation adds code
   - Mitigation: Each phase is independently valuable
   - Phase 1 alone improves current experience
