# Canvas UX Overhaul (Design Spec)

Status: Draft Epic: UX Overhaul Date: 2026-06-09

## Summary

The canvas chrome grew by accretion and now reads as a junk drawer: controls of different scope (global, view, object) sit at the same altitude in one top-right cluster, the splash screen gates entry, there is no recognisable file menu, and there is no way to preview or hold open more than one layout. This spec redefines the canvas shell around a single principle: place each control where its scope lives. Global frame in the top bar, view and history on the canvas, object actions on the object, properties in a side panel. It also replaces the runtime "is the server up" guesswork with an explicit storage mode and an honest storage indicator.

This is a design spec, not an implementation plan. Two areas remain open and are tracked as design spikes (see Open Questions); a third spike, the command palette, is decided build-later and does not block the shell.

## Goals

Make the shell legible by scope. The top bar should answer "who am I, what is open, where is it stored" and nothing else. Make the app open straight to work with no gate. Give layouts a previewable, multi-open home. Make creation and placement feel direct rather than dialog-driven. Present local-only storage as an honest, durable arrangement rather than a failure state.

## Non-goals

Network connectivity between layouts is out of scope here and belongs to its own future epic. Mobile adaptation of the new shell is out of scope for this spec. The command palette is decided build-later; the shell only structures its actions as a command registry so the palette can layer on. None of these are foreclosed: the shell leaves room for a project or site container above the layout, which is where connectivity would later attach.

## Audience

Rackula serves a diverse audience whose mental models differ: AV users who bay open-frame racks into rows, IT and server users who think in standalone enclosed racks, and homelabbers with small mixed setups. Concepts are not universal. The shared-majority workflow, standalone racks and placing devices, is the default and must be frictionless. Domain-specific features such as baying are explicit opt-ins that never trigger by accident and do not clutter the canvas for users who do not use them.

## The shell

### Workspace and tabs

Rackula becomes a multi-layout workspace on the familiar editor and browser model. Layouts open as tabs across the top of the canvas. The sidebar Layouts list is the durable library of everything that exists; tabs are the working set for the current session. On launch the app opens straight to the canvas and restores the full set of tabs that were open, lazily: only the active layout's content loads, the rest load when focused. The old StartScreen is removed entirely: its functions (new layout, import, the saved layouts list) move to the sidebar Layouts tab and the app menu. A true first launch with no layouts shows the existing WelcomeScreen empty state.

Tabs use a real tab shape, support drag to reorder, and reveal a close affordance on hover. Closing a tab never deletes the layout; the layout persists in storage and in the sidebar. Opening a layout from the sidebar focuses its tab if already open, otherwise opens a new one. A tab carries a small unbacked-changes dot only when it is inactive: the active tab needs no dot because the user is looking at that work, and the inactive dots identify which background layout the storage chip's amber state refers to. Tab keyboarding avoids browser-reserved combinations (no Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+Tab) and uses Alt+1 through 9 to jump between tabs. Ctrl+1 through 9 is also browser-reserved (it switches browser tabs in Chrome and cannot be intercepted); Alt+1 through 9 is interceptable in all major browsers and matches the Slack-in-browser convention.

The undo stack is per layout. Closing a tab discards that layout's undo history; the layout itself persists in storage and in the sidebar.

Overflow shrinks tabs to a comfortable minimum near 120px, then a hard floor near 72px, then collapses the remaining tabs into a right-aligned chevron menu that lists the open set only (not the full library). Drag-reorder operates on the visible strip; picking a tab from the chevron brings it back onto the strip. There is no horizontal scroll and no multi-row wrap.

Closing is non-destructive and needs no confirmation: the close affordance is a hover-revealed x (always shown on the active and keyboard-focused tab), and the inactive dot yields to the x in the same slot so the tab width does not jump. The word Close is used for tabs everywhere; Delete is reserved for removing a layout from the sidebar library. A one-time first-run hint explains that closing keeps the layout in the Layouts list. The only confirmation is closing an unsaved new layout that was never added to the library.

Deleting or renaming a layout while a tab is open never closes the tab. A rename live-syncs to the tab title. A delete (from the sidebar or server-side) flips the tab to a recoverable orphan that offers Save as new, for both the active and inactive tab. Duplicate names across open tabs gain a muted qualifier (relative update time, or a short id fragment) only when they collide; the tooltip always carries the unambiguous name and id.

The full tab keyboard map: Alt+1 through 9 jump to a tab, Alt+W closes the current tab, and Alt+[ and Alt+] cycle to the previous and next tab (parallel to bare [ and ] for racks). The reserved combinations Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+Tab, and Ctrl+1 through 9 are avoided because the browser never delivers them to the page. All existing app shortcuts survive unchanged; the map is authored as command-registry entries so the HelpPanel list is generated (#2096).

Twin tabs pause per layout, not per workspace: a Web Lock keyed by layout id elects one editor per layout, so editing one layout never pauses another open elsewhere. Opening a layout that is already a tab focuses that tab, so there is at most one editable in-app tab per layout; the Reload action reloads that one layout's working copy.

Full interaction detail, with the alternatives that were considered, is recorded in docs/research/spike-2018-tabs-interaction-model.md.

### Session restore mechanics

Launch restores the full open tab set lazily (settled): only the active layout's content loads, the rest load when focused. A restored-but-unloaded tab shows its name from the persisted open-set metadata plus a quiet skeleton until focused. The persisted open-set carries enough per-tab metadata (layout id, name, order, active flag) to render tab shells before any layout content is read.

Focusing an unloaded tab hydrates it. If that layout is gone or unreadable, the tab resolves on focus to an inline error with Retry and Remove tab; it never silently vanishes and never reads as deleted when the cause is a transient failure. In server mode, an unreachable server at launch renders the tab shells in an unreachable-and-retrying state under one workspace-level banner, distinct from deleted, and hydrates when the connection returns.

Closing a tab removes it from the open set and discards that layout's undo history only; the durable copy survives in storage and in the sidebar. A returning user with no restorable layouts is told apart from a fresh install by a persisted has-ever-had-layouts signal: a fresh install shows the WelcomeScreen, while lost data shows a distinct recovery state offering Retry, Import a file, and Start fresh. When a save or snapshot POST returns 404 because the layout was deleted server-side, the failed write becomes a Save as new offer so the open copy lands in the library rather than being lost.

The per-layout browser storage schema (#2179) and undo/redo semantics across switch and restore (#2182) are designed separately; this section states the interaction contract they satisfy.

### Top bar and app menu

The top bar carries only the workspace frame: the logo (which is also the app menu), the tab strip, the storage chip, and the Settings gear. Everything else has moved to a more appropriate home.

The app menu is lean. It contains only commands that have no other home: new and open layout, import devices, import from NetBox, new custom device, export image, export backup, share link, view YAML, keyboard shortcuts, and about. Edit and View are not mirrored here because they live on the canvas and in the panel. The menu is storage mode aware: the server build adds Save and Save As for the server library, while the browser build leads with Export backup. App preferences stay behind the Settings gear, not in the app menu.

### Canvas controls

View and history controls live on the canvas, bottom-left, as two visually separated groups. The history group is undo and redo. The view group is zoom out, zoom readout, zoom in, fit, and the display-mode lens. They read as two distinct groups, not one pile.

### Object interaction model

Selecting any object floats its verbs just above it with a small margin. The pattern is identical at both scales:

A selected device shows its verbs floating above the device row: move up, move down, flip face, duplicate, delete, plus a slot control that appears only when the device is half-width. The bar floats above the row with a small margin and flips below when the row is near the rack name, so it never lands on the name.

A selected rack shows its verbs floating above the rack name: duplicate, focus, export, delete. The name stays in place and is itself part of the rack's click target. Selecting a rack includes its name, so nothing reflows.

Right-click mirrors the floating verbs for both. Properties for both dock in the side panel. Verbs float, properties dock. Multi-select surfaces group actions, including Bay together (see Creation).

Verb-bar behaviour at low zoom is unresolved: the bar renders at constant screen-space size, so below some zoom level it is larger than the object it points to and ambiguous about its target. A zoom threshold rule must be defined during implementation breakdown.

### The side panel

The right panel is persistent and tabbed: Edit and View. The Edit tab is contextual and shows properties for the current selection, or an empty-state prompt when nothing is selected. The View tab is always reachable and holds the layout-scoped view toggles (display mode, annotations, rear view). Theme is an app preference and lives behind the Settings gear, not in the View tab. This replaces an earlier mode-swap design in which selecting an object hid the View controls. The panel is collapsible to a slim rail to give the canvas its width back, and it remembers whether it was left collapsed. Multi-select and empty states are first-class.

### Edit panel section components (#1398)

The legacy EditPanel was decomposed into composable section components ahead of this overhaul (#1398). These are the sections the Edit tab (#2077) composes, and they define the contract that tab builds against:

- `EditPanelRack`: rack or group properties (name, height, U numbering, rear-view toggle, notes, annotation field, delete). Props: `selectedRack`, `selectedGroup`.
- `EditPanelMetadata`: device descriptive fields (name, type/brand, height, category, colour, mounted face, power ratings, type notes, IP, placement notes). Props: `selectedDeviceInfo`.
- `EditPanelPosition`: vertical position, half-width slot, container context. Props: `selectedDeviceInfo`.
- `EditPanelImage`: front/rear placement image overrides. Props: `selectedDeviceInfo`.
- `EditPanelActions`: remove from rack, delete custom type. Props: `selectedDeviceInfo`, and an `ondeletetype` callback (the host owns the confirm dialog).

Contract notes for the Edit tab:

- Sections are single-entity: each renders properties for one selected rack or device. The host (today `EditPanel`, later the Edit tab) owns empty-state and multi-select orchestration; sections never branch on nothing-selected.
- Sections access stores via the singleton getters directly. Only the resolved selection (`SelectedDeviceInfo`, `selectedRack`, `selectedGroup`) is passed as props; each section sources the rack id from the selection it receives (`selectedRack.id` / `selectedDeviceInfo.rack.id`). `SelectedDeviceInfo` is exported from `src/lib/types`.
- Transitional: `EditPanelRack` still hosts the rear-view and annotation toggles. These are layout-scoped view state that the View tab (#2078) absorbs; lift them out of `EditPanelRack` when #2078 lands.

## Storage

### Explicit storage mode

Storage mode is declared by configuration, not inferred at runtime. The setting is storage: browser or storage: server. This replaces the previous approach of always probing /api and guessing intent from connection history, which made a deliberately backendless build indistinguishable from a server that was simply down.

The model has three tiers: a file on disk (portable, always available via export and import), the browser (the live working copy, autosaved), and the server (a durable library that survives the browser being cleared, present only in the server build). In the browser build the durable home is the file; the browser holds the working copy. In the server build the durable home is the server; the browser holds the working copy and the file is a portable copy.

The design target for concurrency is one user on multiple devices, not multi-user editing. When the working copy and the server copy diverge (a reconnect after working offline, or another device wrote in between), the resolution is last-write-wins with an automatic pre-overwrite snapshot of the losing copy; there is no merge or prompt UX. Snapshot mechanics are resolved by spike #2019: snapshots live server-side in a snapshots subdirectory of the layout folder, written only when a save's echoed updatedAt mismatches the stored copy (a genuine divergence), keeping the five most recent, restorable from the load dialog as a new write rather than an in-place revert. The startup timestamp comparison moves to the same server-echo semantics, and the browser working copy is kept after server saves rather than cleared. See docs/research/spike-2019-storage-model-data-safety.md.

### The storage chip

A single compact chip lives at the top-right. Its dot answers one question regardless of build: is my work in its durable home. The chip is workspace-wide: it aggregates across all open layouts and shows green only when every open layout is in its durable home. It never shows green while any open tab holds unbacked work; the inactive-tab dots identify which layout the amber state refers to. The chip's states:

Browser build: green "In your browser, backed up" when a recent file backup exists, amber "In your browser, backup needed" when only a working copy exists. The labels differ as well as the colours, so colour is never the sole indicator of state. The app can only know that an export event happened, not that the file still exists on disk. "Recent" is defined change-based (spike #2019): green means zero changes since the last successful export, tracked by a changesSinceExport counter; any unexported change flips the chip amber. A non-modal nudge fires at 30-change multiples so the strict chip does not have to carry the reminder load alone.

Server build: green "Saved to <instance>" when synced, neutral "Saving" while writing, red "<instance> unreachable" when disconnected and working from the browser.

Clicking the chip opens a self-contained popover with the facts (where stored, last backup or sync) and the actions (export all, import, and in the browser build restore from file).

### Messaging

The browser build shows a one-time, first-run notice framed honestly: Rackula runs entirely in your browser, nothing is uploaded, clearing browser data erases layouts, so export a file to keep a copy. It never shows the old "server unavailable" toast, because there is no server to be unavailable. The server build keeps a single, instance-named, reassuring toast when the backend genuinely drops ("Lost connection to <instance>, working from your browser, changes will sync when it reconnects"), fired once, with a quiet recovery toast on resync. The generic "Server unavailable, working offline" toast is removed.

The data-safety and race-condition questions are resolved by spike #2019 (see Open questions: storage).

### Storage mode misconfiguration

The explicit storage mode introduces a failure class the original chip never named: the configured mode contradicting the observable deployment. The chip is the honest surface for it, so it distinguishes configured intent from observed reality (#2063). Two cases, both surfaced in the popover only, with no new toasts and a factual tone.

Browser mode while a server is reachable. A compose --profile persist install without RACKULA_STORAGE_MODE=server, or a partially wired install, runs in browser mode while /api/health answers. Layouts silently stay in the browser with a working server one header away. The chip adds a passive popover line ("A Rackula server is reachable but this instance stores layouts in the browser. Set RACKULA_STORAGE_MODE=server to use it.") and changes nothing else: the dot, label, and durability status stay exactly as the browser build defines them, because the file is still the durable home here. No toast, no nagging. To detect this without re-introducing the runtime guesswork the explicit mode replaced, browser mode runs the same hardened /api/health probe (the one that validates a structured JSON payload, not an SPA fallback) purely to feed this hint.

Server mode where the server was never reached since load. A frontend-only install that declares server mode gets the same treatment as a transient outage forever: an amber chip and an instance-named drop toast, with no hint the deployment itself is broken. The chip now splits the two error classes by whether the API has answered at least once this session, tracked by a one-way ever-reached latch that never falls back on a later loss. Never reached is a distinct chip state ("Server not found", popover copy "Check that the API container is running and RACKULA_STORAGE_MODE matches the deployment.") and fires no drop toast, since nothing was lost. Reached then lost keeps the existing offline treatment, and the instance-named drop toast stays reserved for it. The circuit-breaker trip is always reached-then-lost, since the breaker only opens after save attempts, which require a reachable server.

These decisions follow the spike's messaging posture: name the broken state honestly, fail toward the honest label rather than the reassuring one, and never add a toast where a passive popover line will do.

## Creation and placement

Creation is by placing, not by filling in a dialog. The one exception is defining a custom device type, which is data entry and stays a form launched from the palette.

A new rack is born from a single affordance revealed on hover, arrives at the last-used size (a sticky default, not a fixed 42U), is selected on creation, and is tuned in the panel. There is no upfront modal. On an empty canvas the empty state is itself the call to action to add a rack, and dragging a device onto an empty canvas creates a rack to hold it.

Baying is explicit and opt-in, never emergent from proximity. Dragging racks near each other does not bay them. A bay is formed by selecting two racks and choosing Bay together, or by setting Bay with on a rack in the panel, which is also where the relationship is undone. Standalone is the default and nothing auto-snaps.

Device placement is drag-first with a live preview. The preview must show the unhappy path, not just the happy one: a valid drop highlights the target slots, an invalid drop (overlap, no room, wrong face) shows a red preview and snaps to the nearest legal slot. A non-modal double-click on a palette item places it in the selected rack's next free slot. A keyboard path exists so placement is not mouse-only. All creation and placement is undoable.

## Sidebar Layouts tab

The sidebar gains a third tab beside Devices and Racks: Layouts. It is a compact list of rows, each with a small cached mini-render of the layout, the name, and meta. Open layouts carry a green dot, the active one is highlighted, and the list stays in sync with the tabs. A New layout action sits at the top. Per-row actions (rename, duplicate, export, delete) appear on hover and on right-click. The thumbnail is a real cached render regenerated on save, not a placeholder, so it functions as a preview.

## Accessibility

The new shell changes keyboard navigation extensively, so accessibility is part of the design, not a retrofit. Floating verb bars are reachable by keyboard, not only by pointer. Storage chip state changes are announced to assistive technology. Collapsing and expanding the side panel manages focus rather than dropping it. See `docs/guides/ACCESSIBILITY.md` for the project checklist.

## Open questions (design spikes)

Two areas were tracked as design spikes under the UX Overhaul epic, with the storage spike running first because tabs depend on its semantics. Both are now resolved. A third spike, the command palette, is decided and non-blocking:

Tabs interaction model: resolved by spike #2018, full findings in docs/research/spike-2018-tabs-interaction-model.md. The decisions are folded into Workspace and tabs and Session restore mechanics above: shrink-then-chevron overflow over the open set; non-destructive Close with a single new-layout confirm; orphan-on-delete with Save as new; live rename to title with collision-only disambiguation; lazy restore with title-plus-skeleton shells and an orphan/error fallback; the Alt+1-9 / Alt+W / Alt+[ Alt+] keyboard map authored for the #2096 command registry; per-layout twin-tab pause via a layout-id Web Lock with an at-most-one-editable-tab invariant; server-unreachable restore shown as retrying not deleted; lost-data versus fresh-install empty states; and a 404 on a deleted layout falling through to Save as new (#2041).

Storage model and data safety: resolved by spike #2019, full findings in docs/research/spike-2019-storage-model-data-safety.md. The decisions: the chip is green only at zero changes since the last successful export (a changesSinceExport counter), with a non-modal nudge at 30-change multiples and a persisted snooze; restore-from-file reuses the existing load pipeline behind a confirm when unbacked changes would be replaced; beforeunload warns only on genuine in-flight loss risk. Pre-overwrite snapshots are server-side, written only on a mismatched server-echoed updatedAt, keep five per layout, and restore as a new write. Twin tabs are detect-and-pause via the storage event with a per-tab id, Web Locks serialising writes where available. Storage mode is set by RACKULA_STORAGE_MODE, injected by the container entrypoint as `window.__RACKULA_CONFIG__`, defaulting to browser when no config is present; explicit config always wins and the connection-history probe is deleted.

Command palette: resolved by spike #2020 (full findings in docs/research/spike-2020-command-palette.md, mock in docs/research/spike-2020-palette-mock.svg). Still build-later and non-blocking. The decisions: it is a command-first palette, thin UI projected from the command registry (#2096), built by composing the bits-ui v2.18.1 `Command` component (a Svelte port of cmdk, with the ARIA combobox/listbox model and a fuzzy scorer built in) inside the existing bits-ui `Dialog` - no new dependency and no custom accessibility code. Invocation is Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on macOS) bound on keydown capture with preventDefault, plus a required visible "Search or jump to..." pill in the top bar's reserved slot (#2072), because Ctrl+K interception is reliable but not universal (Chrome/Edge on Windows can steal it) and the palette must never be the sole path to a command. Behaviour: built-in fuzzy ranking plus registry keyword aliases, a small MRU recents list in localStorage, and selection-aware contextual commands, over an empty state that is never blank (recents, then the current selection's verbs, then a short grouped command list). Device search and placement stay in the Devices sidebar; a palette "Add device..." sub-mode is an optional later follow-on, not v1. Implementation is decomposed into #2212 (shell), #2213 (recents and contextual commands), and #2214 (optional device sub-mode), all sequenced after #2096, #2073, and #2075.

## Out of scope

Connectivity between layouts is a separate future epic; this shell leaves a project-or-site-container-shaped hole above the layout for it. Mobile adaptation of the new shell is not covered here. The command palette is build-later, not part of this shell work beyond the command registry.

## Decision log

The top bar is the workspace frame only; other controls moved by scope. App opens straight to the canvas. App menu is lean and storage-mode aware. Storage mode is explicit (browser or server) over a three-tier file, browser, server model, surfaced by one honest chip. Object verbs float above the object (device above the row, rack above the name), properties dock in the panel. The panel is tabbed Edit and View, collapsible, with multi-select and empty states. Creation is by placing with a sticky default size; baying is explicit opt-in; placement preview shows valid and invalid drops. Sidebar Layouts tab is compact rows with cached previews. Tab switching is Alt+1 through 9 (Ctrl+1 through 9 is browser-reserved and non-interceptable in Chrome). The storage chip is workspace-wide: green only when every open layout is in its durable home. The undo stack is per layout and is discarded when its tab closes. Launch restores the full open tab set lazily (only the active layout's content loads). The design target for concurrency is one user on multiple devices: server-mode conflicts resolve last-write-wins with an automatic pre-overwrite snapshot, no merge or prompt UX. Browser-mode backup is manual export plus nudges; no persistent-file-handle mechanism for now. The command palette is build-later; shell actions are structured as a command registry so it can layer on. Theme lives behind the Settings gear as an app preference; the View tab holds layout-scoped toggles only. Delivery is incremental in coherent slices on main, no long-lived branch; the storage spike runs before the tabs spike. Spike #2019 resolved the storage questions: chip green is strict zero-changes-since-export with a 30-change nudge cadence; snapshots are server-side and mismatch-only via a server-echoed updatedAt, keep five, restore as a new write; the browser working copy is kept after server saves; twin tabs detect-and-pause; storage mode comes from RACKULA_STORAGE_MODE via an entrypoint-injected `window.__RACKULA_CONFIG__`, defaulting to browser (see docs/research/spike-2019-storage-model-data-safety.md).

Spike #2018 resolved the tabs interaction model (see docs/research/spike-2018-tabs-interaction-model.md). The governing principle is trust the model: closing is always non-destructive because the layout persists in the library. Overflow shrinks tabs to a comfortable minimum then collapses the tail into a chevron menu over the open set, no scroll or multi-row. Close uses a hover x with no confirm except for an unsaved new layout not yet in the library; Delete is sidebar-only wording. Delete-while-open orphans the tab with a Save as new offer rather than closing it; rename live-syncs to the title; duplicate names disambiguate only on collision. Restore is lazy with title-plus-skeleton shells, an orphan-or-error fallback on focus, and a retrying (not deleted) state when the server is unreachable; lost-data and fresh-install empties are distinguished by a persisted has-ever-had-layouts signal. The tab keyboard map is Alt+1-9 jump, Alt+W close, Alt+[ and Alt+] cycle, authored as command-registry entries for the generated HelpPanel (#2096). Twin tabs pause per layout via a layout-id Web Lock with an at-most-one-editable-tab-per-layout invariant, and a 404 on a deleted server layout falls through to Save as new (#2041). Undo across switch and restore (#2182) and the browser per-layout storage schema (#2179) are designed separately.

Spike #2179 resolved the browser-mode multi-layout storage schema (see docs/research/spike-2179-browser-multilayout-storage-schema.md). localStorage only for now (IndexedDB tabled as a quota-triggered follow-up, since browser mode may be retired with the Cloudflare Workers migration): one workspace index key (`Rackula:workspace`: schemaVersion, activeId, ordered openTabs, and a library map carrying per-layout name, updatedAt, and the durability counters) read synchronously at launch to paint tab shells, plus one body key per layout (`Rackula:layout:<id>`) loaded lazily on focus. The old single `Rackula:autosave` slot is adopted once into the first layout then deleted. Closing a tab drops it from openTabs only; the body and library entry persist. Quota failures never auto-evict; they surface through the chip. The twin-tab Web Lock and storage events re-key per layout id, and the index is the single durability source for the chip rollup (#2035), tab dots (#2079), and sidebar dots (#2082).

A 2026-06-10 scope review of surfaces left untouched by the shell list added six items and three guard rails. Dialogs unify on one primitive with three sizes (S 420, M 560, L 720) that renders as a bottom sheet on mobile, replacing nine ad hoc dialog widths and the dialog-versus-sheet split (#2092); it sequences before the side panel and settings. Settings consolidate into a sectioned dialog (Appearance, Behaviour, Data) behind the gear, and the theme toggles in the canvas context menu and HelpPanel are removed so the gear is the single home (#2093). The command registry decided for the palette becomes a now-not-later foundation: a typed registry (id, label, shortcut, scope, enabled-when) feeds the app menu, verb bars, keyboard handler, and a generated HelpPanel shortcut list, eliminating hand-maintained shortcut docs (#2096). The Devices palette gains a pinned favourites section, virtualized rendering, and a visible display-mode toggle in one pass (#2094). The empty-canvas state becomes a template chooser (.rackula.yaml templates in static/templates, validated in CI against the published schema #571, previews via the cached render pipeline; a v1 chooser may land earlier on the existing WelcomeScreen with static preview images, with only the entry-point routing) landing together with StartScreen removal (#2095). Mobile implementation is deferred to M012, but the design spike (#2097) runs at milestone start, before #2075/#2076 implementation, so the new panel and dialog primitives are not rebuilt bespoke for touch. Three guard rails land before shell slices and are milestoned in M014 as wave 0 (no shell slice merges until they are green): visual regression snapshots (#2098), axe-core accessibility CI (#2099), and UX standards (WCAG 2.2 AA, 44px touch targets, reduced motion, visible focus, managed focus) documented as PR gates (#2100).

## Alignment audit amendments (2026-06-12)

A cross-milestone audit (M002/M003/M004/M013/M014/M015) amended this spec. Full report: the align-roadmap session plan file; per-issue details live on the issues.

### Canonical homes

| State | Canonical control | Mirrors | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display mode | Bottom-left lens (#2074) | View tab (#2078), palette toggle (#2094) | Layout |
| Annotations | View tab (#2078) | none (removed from #2093 Appearance) | Layout |
| Theme | Settings dialog (#2093) | none | App preference |
| Per-layout durability | Chip derived API (#2035) | Tab dots (#2079), sidebar dots (#2082) | Workspace rollup |

### Sequencing amendments

- M003's carrier-first epic (#2158) lands before M014 placement/drag/verb-bar work: the verb bar's slot control (#2075) is designed against the carrier model, not the slot_position pathway #2158 deletes.
- Wave 0 additions alongside the guard rails: browser-mode multi-layout storage schema design (#2179), undo/redo semantics across restore and tab switch (#2182), E2E shell strategy (#2183), i18n decision (#2184), performance budget (#2185).
- #2073 split: menu shell (#2073, mode-agnostic, after #2096) and mode-aware items (#2187, needs #2037). #2081 depends only on the shell slice.
- #2045 (export-all) moved into M014 to ride tabs; in server mode it flushes pending debounced saves before building the archive.
- The interim top bar (#2072) ships with an empty flex slot; the full logo/menu/tabs/chip/settings layout is the end state, not the slice's exit criteria.

## Command palette spike amendment (2026-06-13)

Spike #2020 resolved the command palette (still build-later, non-blocking). It is a command-first palette, thin UI projected from the registry (#2096), built by composing bits-ui v2.18.1's `Command` component (Svelte cmdk: ARIA combobox/listbox + fuzzy scorer built in) inside the existing bits-ui `Dialog` - no new dependency. Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on macOS) is the primary invocation, paired with a required visible "Search or jump to..." pill in the #2072 top-bar slot, because Ctrl+K interception is reliable but not universal (Chrome/Edge on Windows can steal it) and the palette is never the sole path to a command (guaranteed by the registry being the single source for menu, verb bars, keyboard, help, and palette). Behaviour: built-in fuzzy ranking plus keyword aliases, an MRU recents list in localStorage, selection-aware contextual commands, and an empty state that is never blank. Device search and placement stay in the Devices sidebar; a palette "Add device..." sub-mode is an optional later follow-on. Decomposed into #2212 (shell), #2213 (recents and contextual), and #2214 (optional device sub-mode), sequenced after #2096, #2073, #2075.
